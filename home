Welcome to my academic homepage!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of South Africa (iNanoWS Group, College of Science, Engineering and Technology). My research focuses on the development of nanostructured materialsâ€”particularly MOF/Carbon nanocompositesâ€”for environmental and electrochemical applications.

I hold a Ph.D. in Chemistry, with my doctoral thesis titled:  
**"Development of MOF/Carbon Nanostructured Composite Electrodes for Electrochemical Sensing and Degradation of Wastewater Pollutants."**

My work integrates sustainable materials, environmental remediation, and sensor technology.
