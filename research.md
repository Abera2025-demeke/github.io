### ðŸ”¬ Research Overview

My research centers on the synthesis and application of MOF/Carbon nanocomposite materials for environmental and electrochemical uses.

Key topics:
- Fabrication of novel hybrid nanostructures
- Electrochemical sensing of heavy metals
- Adsorptive degradation of wastewater pollutants
- Integration of nanomaterials into real-world sensing devices
- Green synthesis approaches

I am also exploring solid-state batteries and desalination technologies via membrane filtration.
